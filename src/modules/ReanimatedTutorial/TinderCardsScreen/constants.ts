      'The folksy Hochul has a far deeper relationship with her faith, her family and the upstate region that nurtured her. She came of age in Hamburg, a right-leaning inner-rim suburb south of Buffalo. It’s an old farm town of some 59,000 people that stretches over about 40 square miles, a leafy lakeside community sprinkled with loping traffic circles and single-family Colonial-style homes. Natives take pride in the village’s friendly feel, its slow pace of life and, perhaps most of all, its status as host to the annual Erie County Fair, one of the largest county fairs in the U.S. Hochul, herself a regular at the fair, served more than a decade on the town board and enjoys hometown support from both sides of the political divide. On recent afternoons, locals praised her as they relaxed in the village’s brick-sidewalk-lined main drag, fondly remembering her as a fighter for the community and for moderate, upstate sensibilities.',

      'Every time we open a box with a new iPhone or iPad, we are upset that the kit is getting poorer and the box is getting thinner. Then the headphones will be removed, then the adapter for charging. But there is something that lasts forever - the famous Apple logo stickers. Having bought an iPad 4, I thought it was some kind of joke and a nice bonus that just pleases the eye. But with each new iPhone, there were more and more questions, and the answers were never added. These stickers can be found everywhere, but there is still no clear answer as to why they are needed. It seems that the iPhone will no longer be sold in a box, but the mysterious stickers will remain. We conducted our own investigation to find out why they are needed, where our readers stick them, and why there are two stickers.',
