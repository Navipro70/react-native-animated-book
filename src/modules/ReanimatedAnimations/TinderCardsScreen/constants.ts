      'The folksy Hochul has a far deeper relationship with her faith, her family and the upstate region that nurtured her. She came of age in Hamburg, a right-leaning inner-rim suburb south of Buffalo. It’s an old farm town of some 59,000 people that stretches over about 40 square miles, a leafy lakeside community sprinkled with loping traffic circles and single-family Colonial-style homes. Natives take pride in the village’s friendly feel, its slow pace of life and, perhaps most of all, its status as host to the annual Erie County Fair, one of the largest county fairs in the U.S. Hochul, herself a regular at the fair, served more than a decade on the town board and enjoys hometown support from both sides of the political divide. On recent afternoons, locals praised her as they relaxed in the village’s brick-sidewalk-lined main drag, fondly remembering her as a fighter for the community and for moderate, upstate sensibilities.',

    description:
      'Every time we open a box with a new iPhone or iPad, we are upset that the kit is getting poorer and the box is getting thinner. Then the headphones will be removed, then the adapter for charging. But there is something that lasts forever - the famous Apple logo stickers. Having bought an iPad 4, I thought it was some kind of joke and a nice bonus that just pleases the eye. But with each new iPhone, there were more and more questions, and the answers were never added. These stickers can be found everywhere, but there is still no clear answer as to why they are needed. It seems that the iPhone will no longer be sold in a box, but the mysterious stickers will remain. We conducted our own investigation to find out why they are needed, where our readers stick them, and why there are two stickers.',

      'The US defence department ordered the emergency use of commercial aircraft to assist in Kabul evacuations. The 18 aircraft from American Airlines, Atlas Air, Delta Air Lines, Omni Air, Hawaiian Airlines, and United, will not be flown into Kabul but will instead be used to move people from temporary safe havens and military bases. Western countries are rushing to evacuate their citizens in addition to Afghans who helped the NATO effort and others who are vulnerable after the Taliban took over the capital city a week ago. At least seven people died in the chaos outside the Kabul airport, the British military said on Sunday, as people desperately flood the airport trying to flee. The US embassy in Kabul meanwhile warned that there were potential security threats outside the airport and advised Americans to avoid traveling to the airport and to avoid airport gates at this time',

It will allow more Russian gas exports to reach Europe and is nearing completion. "We agree with the Americans that gas should not be used as a geopolitical weapon, and this will be reflected in the question of whether there will be an extension of this amount, of the transit contract through Ukraine, and the sooner this happens the better," Merkel said.',

In the wake of their creation and approval by the relevant medical authorities, the roll-out of coronavirus vaccines has occurred at breakneck speed in some countries. In the United States, for instance, over 70 per cent of American adults have received at least one vaccine dose by the start of August, with more than 50 per cent - some 168 million Americans - fully vaccinated, according to Johns Hopkins University.',

Retailers have had to rethink their strategies in order to compete in the market. More and more brands have moved to only online trading as digital sales soar. The pandemic also altered the sector, putting the final nail in the coffin of many struggling high street shops as restrictions meant many were closed to the public.',
